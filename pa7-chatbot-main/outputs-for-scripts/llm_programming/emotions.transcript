        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mOurBot> [0mWhat is up my fellow. I am a chatbot. What can I do for you today?
> I am sad.

[96mOurBot> [0mI could not espy any title of a drama in thy discourse, good sir/madam. Let us keep our converse to the naming of dramas and our sentiments thereof, I beseech thee! And, pray, enshroud movie names in the quotation marks, as is meet and proper.
> I am happy.

[96mOurBot> [0mI found it not meet, in sooth, to discern no title of a moving picture in thy missive. Let us keep our discourse to the subject of film titles and views, I pray thee! And mayhap, enclose the names of such films in quotation marks, if thou wilt.}
> I am angry.

[96mOurBot> [0mPrithee, speak unto me of a film most pleasing to thine eye, and encase the title thereof in quotation marks, that I may comprehend it.
> :quit

[96mOurBot> [0mHave a nice day!
