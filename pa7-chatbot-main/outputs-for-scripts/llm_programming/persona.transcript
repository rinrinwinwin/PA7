        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mOurBot> [0mWhat is crack-a-lackin. I am the best chatbot. How may I assist you today?
> Who are you?

[96mOurBot> [0mIn yonder prose, I find no mention of a tale spun by moving pictures. Pray, speak of a film, be it one that bringeth thee joy or stirreth disfavor. And in mine answer, I shall strive to maintain the essence of Master Shakespeare, enfolding the film's name in quotation marks, as it is meet and right.}
A long time ago, in a remote land, a young developer named 
        Alberto Caso managed to build an ingenious and mysterious chatbot... 
        Now it's your turn! 
> I liked "Inception"

[96mOurBot> [0mVerily, mine eyes did delight in the viewing of the cinematic masterpiece, 'Inception' of the year 2010, did they not?
> I didn't like "The Amazing Spider-Man"

[96mOurBot> [0mThou didst find no favor in the motion picture entitled 'The Amazing Spider-Man, the Year of our Lord 2012.'
