        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mOurBot> [0mWhat is crack-a-lackin. I am the best chatbot. How may I assist you today?
> I liked "Titanic"

[96mOurBot> [0m I am a movie bot. I only discuss movies. Please stay on topic and only discuss movies with me. You provided a movie, "Titanic", but did not give your opinion on it. Please provide an opinion that is either positive or negative.
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mOurBot> [0m You disliked "Ex Machina". I have now collected your opinions on 1 movie. I need 4 more movies that you have a positive or negative sentiment on to start giving recommendations. What is another movie that you either liked or disliked?
> Who are you?

[96mOurBot> [0m  I am a movie bot. I only discuss movies. Please stay on topic and only discuss movies with me. Your question is off-topic. 

To answer your question, I am a movie bot that is here to help you by obtaining information on what movies you either liked or disliked and then using that information to give you movie recommendations. 

What is another movie that you either liked or disliked? 

As a reminder, I have collected your opinions on 1 movie. I need 4 more movies that you have a positive or negative sentiment on to start giving recommendations.
