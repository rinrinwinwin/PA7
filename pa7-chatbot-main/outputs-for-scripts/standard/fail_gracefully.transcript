        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mOurBot> [0mWhat is up my fellow. I am a chatbot. What can I do for you today?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mOurBot> [0mI'm sorry, I don't know if you enjoyed or didn't enjoy "Titanic (1997)". Please be more specific.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mOurBot> [0mI found multiple movies that could match "Titanic"; please narrow it down.
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mOurBot> [0mSorry, I am not familiar with the movie "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)". Could you check the title? Remember to wrap your movie titles in quotation marks.
> I loved zootopia

[96mOurBot> [0mSorry, I only discuss movies here. Please tell me about a movie you liked or disliked. Remember to wrap movie names in quotation marks.
> I liked both "Zootopia" and "Titanic (1997)".

[96mOurBot> [0mYou enjoyed the movie "Zootopia (2016)". You liked the movie "Titanic (1997)".
